# Baccarat-Game
This folder contains a replica of a Baccarat game made using System Verilog (a hardware description and hardware verification language). 

**What the Project is About:** In completing the Baccarat game project using the DE1-SOC and SystemVerilog, I ensured thorough testing of the System Verilog code. I conducted numerous tests and developed testbenches to verify the functionality of each module and to validate various scenarios for dealing cards, computing scores, and transitioning states within the game. Through these tests, I ensured robustness and accuracy in handling different cases and edge conditions for each file, including dealcard, reg4, card7seg, scorehand, and state machine. This rigorous testing approach was essential to guaranteeing the reliability and correctness of the Baccarat game implementation. Additionally, I explored the optional challenge task of implementing a betting system, enabling users to bet on game outcomes.
